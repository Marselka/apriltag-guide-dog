This is a part of a walking robot project.
This part performs estimation of camera frame pose relative to AprilTag and sends commands to Arduino, including number of steps to go either forward-backward or right-left to correct robot's position. 

Python3 script is launched on Raspberry Pi 3 Model B.  
Dependencies: `cv2`, `apriltag`, `serial`, `yaml`

`cam_intrinsics` folder entities are generated by Kalibr software and provide calibration constants for certain camera.  

Arduino code is for checking right workflow: toogling led and sending response.
